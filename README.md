# Crop Disease Identification Model üåøüîç

Welcome to the Crop Disease Identification Model repository! This project is a deep learning-based system designed to help farmers identify crop diseases from images. By detecting and managing crop health issues promptly, farmers can work towards improving yield and quality in their farms.

## About
Crop diseases can have a significant impact on agricultural productivity. Early detection and accurate identification of these diseases are crucial for farmers to take necessary actions to prevent the spread and minimize damage to their crops. This model uses convolutional neural networks (CNN), decision tree classifiers, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forests, and machine learning techniques to predict and classify various crop diseases based on input images.

## Features
- Utilizes deep learning algorithms for accurate disease identification.
- Provides farmers with a tool to manage and control crop diseases effectively.
- Helps in improving crop yield and quality through timely intervention.
- Supports multiple crop types for comprehensive disease detection.

## How It Works
The model processes input images of crops and analyzes them using pre-trained CNN models to identify patterns and features associated with different diseases. The decision tree classifier, KNN, and random forest algorithms then make predictions based on these features to accurately classify the crop diseases present in the image. The system provides farmers with quick and reliable information to take necessary steps to address the identified diseases.
